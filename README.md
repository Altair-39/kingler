![AUR version](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/krabby-bin)

Krabby is mostly a Rust rewrite of phoney badger's [pokemon-colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts) with some extra features. It is around 7x faster than the original shell script âš¡.

## Installation

### Arch Linux x86_64 (and derivatives)

From the AUR using your favorite AUR helper

```
yay -S krabby-bin
```

Or alternatively you can manually download the PKGBUILD file from the repository, then run
```
makepkg -si
```

### Installing from source (other distros and MacOS)

To install krabby from source, you will need Rust. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Now using cargo, run
```
cargo install krabby
```
Make sure you have `.cargo/bin` added to your shell `PATH`. This can be done by adding the following to your `.profile`, `.bash_profile` or `.zprofile`
```sh
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin"
```

## Usage
Run the help command `krabby help` to see the following help message.

```

directory (usually `~/.config`) under `krabby/config.toml` if it doesn't exist already. 

```toml
# The language to use when printing the pokemon's name and/or description.
# Possible options include en (English), fr (French), de (German), ja (Japanese),
# zh_hans (Chinese with simplified characters), zh_hant (Chinese with traditional characters)
language = 'en'

# The probability to show a shiny pokemon when using the random command
shiny_rate = 0.0078125
